    <h1>About Grant Holley</h1>
    <p>I'm an American full stack web developer living in Tokyo.
    After graduating with a Bachelor's in International Studies and a Master's
    in Linguistics, I taught elementary school for six years in America and Taiwan.
    In 2017, I decided to pursue my dream and moved to Japan in order to study Japanese.
    After working for over two years for Japanese companies relating to e-Commerce, I
    decided to learn web development and enrolled in Le Wagon's coding bootcamp.  I
    am someone who never stops learning strives to develop new skills.</p>
